The Express Responsive Visibility Bundle gives site creators the ability to control a page's content based on the device being used to view the page. This is because the best region for viewing a block can change, depending on whether the display is wide like a desktop or narrow like a mobile device.

The bundle creates a bean type with an entity reference field. It is wrapped about another bean and configured for the display (mobile, tablet, desktop) on which it should be visible.
